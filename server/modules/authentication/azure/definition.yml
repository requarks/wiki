        Alternate issuers to allow. Each line should specify an issuer string. A typical format for the v2 endpoint resembles: https://login.microsoftonline.com/YOUR-TENANT-ID/v2.0. 
        Pro Tip: To retrieve metadata about your tenant, navigate to https://login.microsoftonline.com/TENANT-NAME/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration in your web browser. 
        For instance, to obtain information for a tenant named example.com, you would visit: https://login.microsoftonline.com/example.com/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration. This URL provides detailed metadata concerning the specified tenant.
        Locate the "issuer" field, which holds the issuer string. Simply copy its contents and paste them here for use.
        Useful when using common or organizations endpoints (for multi-tenant auths).
