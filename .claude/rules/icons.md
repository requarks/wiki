# Icons

Icons come from **Iconify** and are referenced the way Iconify references them — `<prefix>:<name>`,
e.g. `mdi:account-edit`. That string is all that content, navigation items and page relations ever
store; no SVG is ever written into content.

- **Admin** (`AdminIcons.vue` → `/_api/icons`) manages which sets exist: adding a set stores its
  metadata only, and enabling/disabling one controls whether its icons can be searched and filled in.
- **`models/icons.ts`** resolves a reference through four tiers — memory, disk
  (`<dataPath>/cache/icons/<prefix>/<name>.json`), the `icons` db table, then the Iconify API. **Only
  the db is permanent**; the disk cache is derived and starts empty on a fresh instance, so never treat
  it as storage. The upstream API is consulted only for an icon nobody has used yet, is capped per
  minute (public routes can trigger a fill), and is skipped entirely when `offline` is set.
- **Serving** is `controllers/icons.ts` under `/_icons`, cached for a year and immutable. Rendering a
  page never resolves an icon server-side.
- **Frontend**: render every icon with `<w-icon :name>` (`components/shared/WIcon.vue`).
  Components that take an `icon` prop go through it too, so every form works there.
  - Every Iconify reference written **literally in this repo's source** is inlined at build time by
    `scripts/generate-icons.mjs` into `src/assets/icons.generated.js` (committed) and drawn as an
    inline `<svg>`. Run `npm run icons` after adding or removing one; `npm run icons:check` fails if the
    bundle drifts. This is why the interface needs no icon webfont — and why nothing an
    administrator does to icon sets can blank it, which fetching at runtime could not promise:
    resolution is gated on the set being enabled, and deleting a set drops every icon stored for it.
  - A reference built at runtime — an icon a **user** picked, stored on a page or nav item — is
    invisible to that scan and falls through to `iconify-icon`, resolving against `/_icons` as
    before. A name assembled by concatenation is therefore a bug: make it a literal.
  - `img:…` renders as an `<img>`. Legacy `las la-cog` / `mdi-check` webfont names are mapped onto
    their Iconify equivalents for data written before the fonts were dropped; do not write new ones.
- Picking an icon calls `POST /_api/icons/materialize`, which is what guarantees the wiki can serve it
  afterwards without the Iconify API.
